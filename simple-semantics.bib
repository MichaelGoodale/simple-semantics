Here we adapt De Groote’s continuation-based presentation of dynamic semantics to minimalist grammars. This allows for a simple and simply typed compositional interpretation scheme for minimalism.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.cub.2024.07.081},
	abstract = {Infants' thoughts are classically characterized as iconic, perceptual-like representations.1,2,3 Less clear is whether preverbal infants also possess a propositional language of thought, where mental symbols are combined according to syntactic rules, very much like words in sentences.4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 Because it is rich, productive, and abstract, a language of thought would provide a key to explaining impressive achievements in early infancy, from logical inference to representation of false beliefs.18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31 A propositional language-including a language of thought5-implies thematic roles that, in a sentence, indicate the relation between noun and verb phrases, defining who acts on whom; i.e., who is the agent and who is the patient.32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39 Agent and patient roles are abstract in that they generally apply to different situations: whether A kicks, helps, or kisses B, A is the agent and B is the patient. Do preverbal infants represent abstract agent and patient roles? We presented 7-month-olds (n = 143) with sequences of scenes where the posture or relative positioning of two individuals indicated that, across different interactions, A acted on B. Results from habituation (experiment 1) and pupillometry paradigms (experiments 2 and 3) demonstrated that infants showed surprise when roles eventually switched (B acted on A). Thus, while encoding social interactions, infants fill in an abstract relational structure that marks the roles of agent and patient and that can be accessed via different event scenes and properties of the event participants (body postures or positioning). This mental process implies a combinatorial capacity that lays the foundations for productivity and compositionality in language and cognition.},
